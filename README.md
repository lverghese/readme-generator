## Description
My project is an automated README.md generator that uses Node.js, Inquirer NPM, and FS (File System) to create README.md files automatically for the user following a set of questions in the terminal.

## Installation
The user must have Node.js, access to an IDE of some sort, and access to a terminal. The user must also install Inquirer npm by running "npm i".

## Usage
To use the application, run "node index.js" in the terminal and answer the prompts until they are all completed. When finished, the README.md file will be generated in the current working directory.

## Contributing
Others can contribute through pull requests or opening an issue.

## Tests
There is no further testing required.
